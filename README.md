## Overview

Quantum computing is a revolutionary field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. This repository contains resources to help you get started with quantum computing and Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below to set up your environment and explore the provided materials.

## Documentation

The `Doc` directory contains two key resources:

- **Presentation**: An introductory presentation on quantum computing.
- **Starter Kit**: A guide to setting up your environment for Qiskit using Miniconda.

## Environment Setup

To create a Qiskit environment, you can use the provided `env.yml` file. Follow these steps:

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to create the Qiskit environment:

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
